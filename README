Preface
--------
The xkcd comic "password strength" (http://xkcd.com/936/) suggests using
"four random common words" as a relatively strong password.  Unfortunately
humans are not good at being random.  Diceware can help with this.

Diceware is a method used for picking random words which consists of
rolling a pair of dice, and then using the resulting number to looking up
a word on a list.

I don't know about the rest of the internet, but I for one, can't be
bothered pulling out dice, and looking up words, so I wrote this small
shell script to do it for me.

Overview
---------
auto_diceware uses strong entropy from /dev/random to get a random number
which is used to look up a random word from the provided word list.

Installation
---------
install 'calc' (package: apcalc)

Usage
---------
./auto_diceware -h
